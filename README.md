# Esport-Database
The Detroit Mercy eSports Club Desktop Application is a powerful tool built using the SQLite database, Java, and JDBC technologies for managing information on players, teams, games, and tournaments. The application allows users to search for games, teams, users, tournaments, and competition information. Captains can update their team's roster, and admins have extensive access to the database, including adding or removing games, creating or deleting teams, and updating tournament and competition information.

# What I learned:
- Designing a database with a conceptual design
